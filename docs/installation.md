# Installation

## Stable release

To install Biobank Tools, run this command in your
terminal:

<div class="termy">

``` console
$ pip install biobank-tools
---> 100%
Successfully installed biobank-tools
```

</div>


This is the preferred method to install Biobank Tools, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip][] installed, this [Python installation guide][]
can guide you through the process.
